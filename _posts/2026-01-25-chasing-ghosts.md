There's this memory I can't shake. A man taking his daughter to the park for ice cream. I read it years ago on a stranger's blog. At least I think I did. The image isn't sharp, it's more of a feeling, a warmth that settled somewhere in my mind and never left. I've searched for that post since, desperately scrolling through archived pages, hoping to find proof that it existed. Nothing. The private entries were deleted, and even the web archive offered no clues. Now I'm not even sure if I'm chasing a real ghost or just a figment of my own imagination. Maybe I imagined it all.

But that uncertainty is exactly what brought me here.

## A Bucket List Thing

Here I am. My first blog post. It's been a long time coming, but I've always wanted to run a blog. Not for the content. Not for a potential audience. Just to have done it, you know? One of those bucket list items you can finally cross off. The idea wasn't always there, though. And how I got here is almost absurd.

## The Satoshi Rabbit Hole

Let me back up. If you’ve ever dabbled in crypto, you probably know the itch I’m talking about: the curiosity, the endless pondering over who Satoshi Nakamoto really is. I fell down one of those rabbit holes, following Reddit threads, citations, and references until I stumbled across three names working at IBM that kept popping up in academic papers ([1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5175914), [2](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0055744)) in some kind of related research fields:

* **Satoshi** Hada  
* Toshiaki Ta**naka**  
* Naohiko Ura**moto**  

And then it hit me: **SATOSHI-NAKA-MOTO**.

Coincidence? Pretty sure. But it was enough to pull me into a page called [Complexity Zoo](https://satoshihada.github.io/complexity-zoo/), a collection of computational complexity classes from theoretical computer science. I could barely make sense of the content.

From there, I found my way to [Hada's blog](https://satoshihada.wordpress.com/). I spent hours there. Partly for the academic content, partly still looking for any hint that might connect him to Satoshi Nakamoto, but mostly for the little glimpses into Hada’s personal life.

And that's where the memory comes from. A father taking his daughter to the park for ice cream. Not so much a visual image, more of a feeling that stayed with me for years. It never really left. It kept coming back, quietly inspiring me to try my hand at writing too.

## Ghosts and Memories

I tried desperately to find that post again. Nothing. Some of the private entries were apparently deleted, and even the web archive offered no clues. So now I'm not even sure if I'm chasing a real ghost or just a figment of memory. Maybe I imagined it all. Maybe my brain stitched together fragments into something that never existed.

But that's exactly the thing, isn't it? That uncertainty, that haunting quality of a memory you can't verify, is what kept pulling me back to the idea of blogging. Something about Hada's writing had planted a seed.

## The Rocky Road to My Own Blog

There was another factor, too: I didn’t want to use a templated blog. I had a vision, a specific feel in mind, and I didn’t want to pay for hosting. I’m not a fan of subscription models or monthly fees. Funny enough, I only learned today that a custom domain costs practically nothing, mere cents per month. All that resistance to “hosting costs” had been based on assumptions I never bothered to verify. Classic.


That's when I stumbled upon GitHub Pages through a [video by Shaw Talebi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9CLhQdLp8w), a free way to create something completely custom. Shout out to Shaw for the explanation.

It seemed like the perfect solution. I just had to build it exactly the way I wanted. Easier said than done for someone like me, a perfectionist drowning in JavaScript. So the project sat there, abandoned, gathering digital dust.

## First Attempts with AI

Before I gave up entirely, I did try to hack something together. ChatGPT helped, and I experimented with Google Jules too. It worked, sort of, but it was clunky. Copy-pasting code snippets, context getting lost, endless back-and-forth. The friction was real. Eventually, I lost sight of the project altogether.

But that ghostly memory of Hada's blog post never really faded. It kept nudging me, reminding me that I wanted to do this. Years passed, and the urge to finally create my own blog resurfaced stronger than ever.

## The Breakthrough with Cursor

This time was different. I had heard about AI-assisted coding tools that actually integrated into the development environment. The choice came down to Cursor or Claude Code. 

Here's where things get interesting from a product perspective: [Cursor](https://cursor.com/home/) won for me because it had the lowest barrier to entry. It's a VS Code fork, and I was already somewhat familiar with VS Code. Not as a proper IDE, mind you, I'd been using it as a notebook and task planner, complete with custom macros to quickly move tasks through different statuses in markdown files. That familiarity mattered.

More importantly, Cursor had a free version. Claude Code didn't, at least not bundled with the free tier of Claude. For someone on the fence, that free trial was the foot in the door.

I burned through the free version in one day. The next day, I paid $20 out of my own pocket. No regrets. I wouldn't want to miss it anymore.

## A Reality Check

Now, don't let anyone tell you AI writes your code and you just sit back. Even with Claude Opus 4.5 powering Cursor, this blog took me over 40 commits to get to a first draft. The mobile responsiveness improvements alone cost me a solid three hours of back-and-forth. AI-assisted doesn't mean effortless. It means you can focus on what matters, your vision, your requirements, while the agent handles the heavy lifting. But you're still very much in the driver's seat.

## A Quick Look at the Competition

Parallel to Cursor, I've also been using Google's [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/). It looks and works almost exactly like Cursor, which makes sense since it's also built on VS Code. But in typical Google fashion, it feels like they've added a bit more polish to the usability and user experience. They also have a free plan that I haven't exhausted yet.

That said, I still find myself reaching for Cursor more often. Habit, maybe. Or maybe it's just that first-mover advantage of having won me over when I was ready to commit.

From a product lens, the lesson is clear: the tool with the lowest barrier to entry wins the initial adoption. What happens after that, retention, expansion, loyalty, that's a different game. But you can't play that game if you never get users through the door in the first place.

## How It All Connects

I'm fascinated by how one thing leads to another. Had I not invested in crypto, I'd never have wondered about Satoshi. Had I not fallen down that rabbit hole, I'd never have wandered onto Hada's blog. Had I not spent hours reading his posts, that tiny, personal detail about a father and daughter and ice cream would never have planted itself in my mind. And had that memory not haunted me for years, quietly inspiring me every time it resurfaced, I might never have found the motivation to finally build this blog.

Life has a strange way of nudging you toward things, if you pay attention. The key is to follow your curiosity, to try things out, even when they seem unrelated to where you want to go.

I still don't know who Satoshi Nakamoto is. But I do know this: AI-assisted development is here to stay. It's not just a novelty anymore, it's a tool that fundamentally changes how we build things. The barrier to creating something custom, something truly yours, has never been lower.

As for me? I'm curious to see where this journey goes next.

Hopefully, CYA again.
